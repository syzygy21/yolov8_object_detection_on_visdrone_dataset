# yolov8_object_detection_on_visdrone_dataset
The notebooks uploaded consist of code to fine tune the YOLOV8 model on the VisDrone dataset which consists of images for object detection research.
The annotations provided in the dataset were first converted to YOLO format for training.

# Validation Results
The following images show the inference results during testing
